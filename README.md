# TB-Burden

The primary objective of this project is to comprehensively analyze and understand the dynamics of 
tuberculosis (TB) from the years 1991 to 2013, utilizing business intelligence tools, particularly **Tableau**, as 
a key enabler to uncover critical insights that can strengthen TB outcomes on a global scale.  

This project seeks to: 
1. Examine Regional and National TB Trends: Pinpoint geographic hotspots and regions with high TB 
burdens, that require intensified focus and intervention in the areas of TB case detection, prevalence, 
incidence, mortality, and death.  
2. Analyze Epidemic Trends: Investigate TB epidemic trends in high-burden countries over 13 periods. 
Assess whether there have been significant improvements in reducing the risk of TB over time in 
specific regions or countries and identify the factors influencing these changes. 
3. Predict Future TB Trends: Predict TB trends in the next 5â€“years for those high Burden regions. 
4. Examine the relationships between TB and HIV: Assess whether there are significant correlations 
between TB incidence, prevalence, mortality, and death rates in relation to HIV co-infection. 
5. Strengthen TB prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategies by understanding patterns and 
allocating resources efficiently. 
6. Analyzing the Relationship Between Economic Growth and TB Burden: Assess how GDP per capita 
influences TB prevalence and mortality rates, helping to determine if economic development directly 
contributes to disease reduction. 
7. Evaluating Human Development Factors and TB Outcomes: Investigate how HDI components such 
as healthcare access, education, and living standards impact TB incidence and mortality. 
8. Examining Healthcare Efficiency in TB Detection and Control: Compare TB case detection rates 
across different economic and human development levels to assess the effectiveness of healthcare 
systems in diagnosing and managing TB cases.
